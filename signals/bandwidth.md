# Bandwidth

We have seen that a full audio signal (to your ears!) will be perceived from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. We can refer to this as the bandwidth. Sometimes we reduce the bandwidth to make signalling easier or economical.

For example, a landline telephone probably allows signals from 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz with a bandwidth of 3.1 kHz, thatâ€™s why it sounds a bit tinny. Long Wave or Medium Wave Radio has a bandwidth of 5 or 10 kHz, sounding almost as bad. VHF radio uses a bandwidth of 200 kHz and that sounds almost as good as a CD.
