# Harmonics

Sometimes we use the term _harmonics_ to describe frequencies that “sound good” with other frequencies. This works because the frequencies have a mathematical relationship to each other. On a piano, middle C has a frequency of 261.626 Hz. The next C above middle C has a frequency of c. 523 Hz....double!

To make a major chord, the frequencies have a ratio of 4:5:6. For example a major chord from middle C would have a next note at (261.626/4) \* 5 = 327 Hz or the key of E.

In signals, if the first or fundamental frequency (first harmonic) is X Hz, the frequencies of the next harmonics are: 2\*Hz (2nd harmonic), 3\*Hz (3rd harmonic), 4\*Hz (4th harmonic). The waves sound good to us because the peaks and troughs tend to line up. We call waves which behave like that _in phase_.
