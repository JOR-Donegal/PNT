# Signals

Getting computers to talk to each other involves using light or electrical signals (physics) to send numbers (maths) through data communication networks (engineering)…. bit complicated! This short paper is intended to take you through the first of these, signals.

Signals are variations in some value (air pressure, voltage, current, radio waves, light) which can be used to transmit information. Most signals tend to use varying or oscillating electrical waves to send information, for reasons we will see later.
