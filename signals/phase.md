# Phase

_Phase_ is a very important concept to us. We say that a wave goes from one peak to another in 360 degrees (like a circle). A wave that starts 30 degrees after an initial wave is said to be 30 degrees out of phase.

I created some extra columns in my Excel sheet, the graph below shows 3 SIN waves, 30 degrees out of phase and 60 degrees out of phase.
