# Modulation

I figure that everyone has heard Morse code, if not, try \[1].

With Morse code, we have a tone (called a carrier) which is pulsed on briefly to make a dot or for a longer time to make a dash. The letter A (a symbol) is coded as DOT DASH. This is a form of _modulation_, where a carrier is switched on and off to encode a signal and transmit a symbol. There are many forms of modulation.

You need to be familiar with the terms as they are used in modern telecommunications.
