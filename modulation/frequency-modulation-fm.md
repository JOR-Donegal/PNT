# Frequency Modulation (FM)

Frequency Modulation (FM) is a bit more useful for us music lovers.

In this case, we change the frequency of the carrier in response to the modulating signal. This kind of modulation is much more immune to noise. However, instead of using a single frequency, FM uses a band of frequencies around the carrier. How much frequency spectrum is used is referred to as bandwidth.

Consider a carrier with a frequency of Fc modulated by a signal with a frequency of F0

Where the signal F0 is positive, the frequency is added to the carrier Fc. Where it is negative, it is subtracted.

The resultant waveform varies in frequency from F0 + Fc to F0 - Fc
