# Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)

The most complex modulation we will consider is a combination of some of these techniques called _Quadrature Amplitude Modulation_ (QAM).

Waves are combined with differing phases and amplitudes to create a complex resultant wave. If the channel quality is good, a high number of bits can be communicated per cycle. For example, QAM16 has 16 symbols/4 bits, QAM64 has 64 symbols/8 bits.

Typical wireless broadband services use 64QAM.

Power line Ethernet uses up to 4,096QAM and the (current!) most advanced DSL technology uses 32,768QAM.
