# Asynchronous Serial Communications

One of the oldest and simplest ways we can communicate is via _serial links_. Ones and zeros are represented as voltage levels and each bit follows the other down a wire. Imagine we had a keyboard connected via a serial link to a computer. We would be sending one character at a time, the user could press a key at any random time, so characters could come down the wire at any time. This is called an _asynchronous link_. We need a way to distinguish the start of a character; this is called the _start bit_ and will always be a 1 (because if it was a 0, we could not distinguish it from a line with no activity). After this, we could transmit our character. In early systems, we did this using 7 bits. We need to be able to show that we have finished sending the character. This is because there is no timing information between the two sides of a link. The only way we can synchronize the two sides is to know where a character starts and stops. Normally we use two _stop bits_.

In the example shown, we have a single character being sent, with the binary code 0110010. We mentioned timing above. Our serial links can have a range of speeds; the standard bit rate speeds are 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400. I have seen a 400kb/s speed quoted.

There are many examples of standard protocols which use serial links. The most common is _RS-232_. This is an old standard now and most laptops no longer have it. Every technical person has an adapter in their laptop case which allows them to use RS-232 over USB and you can buy an adapter like that on line for a few euros. If you donâ€™t have one ORDER ONE NOW! You cannot configure network equipment of appliances without it. When you connect to a Cisco switch or router via a blue serial cable, this is RS-232.

If you are doing longer range serial connections, you might use a standard like _RS-422_ or _RS-485_. For very long connections in industrial sites, we use a 4-20mA current loop. For IoT sensors, I use _1-wire_ devices, a specific proprietary protocol that is both simple and cheap.
